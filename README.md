# European Capitals Quiz

A simple, neat and challenging quiz game about capitals in European countries.


## Purpose

My aim was to build a quiz in the uttermost simple and pure design and layout as possible. 
With no disturbance of any obstacles nor any risk to be misguided or even be able to push at the wrong button.
There will only be.


## Intro page

At the first page, player is welcomed to play the quiz and information about score counting is provided before starting the game. Everything is visible at first glance and very clear 


## Game play

The game is started once the player clicks the first and only button visible at the start page, the "Start Quiz" button.
When the player enters the game they will be provided with a name of a capital city in Europe which they will have to pair with the correct country given in four different alternatives, each with a button.
As the quiz game goes on, the player is able to keep track of their score at all time through the game.
After the last question, the player will be notified at a blank page that the quiz has been finished.
The total score will be presented as well as high score and an option to try the quiz all over again.
If the player makes another try round and get better result - the high score will be updated with the highest score for the session. hej
