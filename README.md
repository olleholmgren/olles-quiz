## Purpose

My aim was to build a quiz in the uttermost simple and pure design and layout as possible. 
With no disturbance of any obstacles nor any risk to be misguided or even be able to push at the wrong button.
There will always be only one simple and easy path for the player to go:

- Start Quiz

- Answer questions right/wrong

- Finish

- Get scores

- Start over

In my own opinion, there will always be people interested in geography and quizzes - so i have combined these two
into a 100% functioning game with score counting. It can be used by the player for pure enjoyment but also a good way 
for a person to learn European capitals by heart.

The main inspiration for doing this quiz is - of course - my own interest in geography.

## Intro page

At the first page, player is welcomed to play the quiz and information about score counting is provided before starting the game. Everything is visible at first glance and very clear

## Game play

The game is started once the player clicks the first and only button visible at the start page, the "Start Quiz" button.

When the player enters the game they will be provided with a name of a capital city in Europe which they will have to pair with the correct country given in four different alternatives, each with a button.

As the quiz game goes on, the player is able to keep track of their score at all time through the game.
After the last question, the player will be notified at a blank page that the quiz has been finished.
The total score will be presented as well as high score and an option to try the quiz all over again.
If the player makes another try round and get better result - the high score will be updated with the highest score for the session.

In this way, the player is encouraged to challenge either themselves or with other friends. To see who can get the highest score.

## Testing

The quiz is 100% responsive and is fully playable on any device whether it is a smart phone, tablet or a desktop computer.

One great feature with this easy-to-use game is that when played on a smart phone, the player can play with only one hand and every answer button is 
reachable for the right or left thumb, depending on which hand the player is playing with.

Testing of the responsiveness has been done by opening the Google Dev Tools 'inspect' function in the Chrome browser, and then dragged the side list in order to see that it is responsive in all preferred screen sizes.

## Deployment

In the end, I deployed my quiz game page to GitHub.com.
- First, I made sure that I have made all my 'git add .' and 'git commit -s'.
- Then I went over to my repository in GitHub, navigated to 'Settings' -> 'Pages'.
- In 'Pages', under the 'Source' section I deployed my page from the 'main branch'.


## Conclusion

With this milestone 2nd project I have gotten a broader picture about the interactive possibilities with
JavaScript. Also gave me the wider experience on how to manipulate the HTML document. How to use functions and if statements/conditions.

The number one guidance through this milestone has been received from my excellent mentor Spencer Barriball
at Code Institute who was my biggest help when times got rough. 
Apart from that, most of the knowledge I have gotten through the Love Maths walkthrough from Code Institute.

For future use, I can develop this quiz game and make all different sorts of improvements. Even be able to make it as 
a fun learning tool for my own children.

One thing that will be very interesting is to later come back to this project in maybe a year from now and see how I probably will 
be able to creating it in a much more simple way and straight-forward way.
